## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Backend (TDD)
- [ ] Setup E2E test structure (`npm install` in tests/)
- [ ] Write test: User can register with username/password
- [ ] Implement: Configure Convex Auth Password provider
- [ ] Write test: Duplicate username fails
- [ ] Implement: Username uniqueness validation
- [ ] Write test: User can sign in with correct credentials
- [ ] Implement: Sign-in functionality
- [ ] Write test: Invalid credentials fail appropriately
- [ ] Implement: Error handling

### Phase 2: Frontend (TDD)
- [ ] Write test: RegisterForm renders correctly
- [ ] Implement: RegisterForm component
- [ ] Write test: Form validation works
- [ ] Implement: Client-side validation
- [ ] Write test: LoginForm renders correctly
- [ ] Implement: LoginForm component
- [ ] Write test: Dashboard shows username
- [ ] Implement: Dashboard updates

### Phase 3: E2E & Validation
- [ ] Write E2E test: Registration flow
- [ ] Write E2E test: Login/logout flow
- [ ] Generate validation trace
- [ ] Create test report
- [ ] Document any issues or learnings

## Schema Changes

```typescript
// convex/schema.ts updates needed
users: defineTable({
  // ... existing fields
  username: v.optional(v.string()),
  isAnonymous: v.optional(v.boolean()),
  email: v.optional(v.string()),
  name: v.optional(v.string()),
})
  .index("by_username", ["username"]),
```

- `app/convex/__tests__/passwordAuth.test.ts` - New test file

### Frontend
- `app/src/components/auth/RegisterForm.tsx` - New
- `app/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` - New
- `app/src/components/auth/__tests__/RegisterForm.test.tsx` - New

- `app/src/app/page.tsx` - Update to show username

### E2E Tests
- `tasks/00007-password-authentication/tests/package.json` - Playwright
- `tasks/00007-password-authentication/tests/playwright.config.ts` - Config
- `tasks/00007-password-authentication/tests/e2e/password-auth.spec.ts` - Tests

## Key Commands

```bash
# Backend tests
cd app && npx vitest run convex/__tests__/passwordAuth.test.ts

# Frontend tests
cd app && npx vitest run src/components/auth/

# E2E tests
cd tasks/00007-password-authentication/tests
npx playwright test                    # Headless
npx playwright test --headed          # With browser
npx playwright test --ui              # Interactive

# View trace
npx playwright show-trace validation-videos/password-auth-trace.zip
```

## Required Reading

Before implementing:
1. `docs/development/TESTING-QUICK-START.md` - E2E setup
2. `docs/development/workflow.md` - TDD cycle
3. `docs/architecture/convex-rules.md` - Backend patterns
4. [Convex Auth Password Docs](https://labs.convex.dev/auth/config/passwords)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All backend tests passing
- [ ] All frontend tests passing
- [ ] E2E test covering registration → login → dashboard
- [ ] Validation trace generated
- [ ] Test report documenting coverage
- [ ] Structured logging throughout
- [ ] Code follows Convex rules
