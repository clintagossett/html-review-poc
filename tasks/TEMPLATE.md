## Subtasks

For complex tasks, break work into numbered subtasks. Each subtask gets its own folder with a README defining scope, deliverables, and status.

### Subtask Structure

```
tasks/XXXXX-task-name/
├── README.md                           # Main task file (this template)
├── 01_subtask_descriptive-name/
│   ├── README.md                       # Subtask requirements & status
│   ├── SQL_query_name.sql              # Self-contained SQL (if applicable)
│   └── output_file.csv                 # Deliverable
├── 02_subtask_another-name/
│   ├── README.md

### Subtask README Template

## Objective

What this subtask accomplishes.

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `README.md` | This file |
| `output.csv` | Deliverable description |

## Requirements

Detailed requirements for the deliverable.

## How This Will Be Used

How the output feeds into the next step or final goal.
```

### When to Use Subtasks

- **Multi-phase analysis** - Each phase has distinct deliverables (e.g., data extraction -> analysis -> visualization)
- **Sequential dependencies** - Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 output
- **Agent handoffs** - Clear scope for different sessions/agents to pick up
- **Complex SQL work** - Each query gets its own self-contained file

### Subtask Naming Convention

- Format: `NN_subtask_descriptive-name/`
- Zero-padded numbers: `01_`, `02_`, etc.
- Kebab-case description: `threshold-analysis`, `data-enrichment`
